# Math & Notation Foundations — PERFECT EXAM NOTES

## 1. Number System & Sets

### Definitions

* **Natural numbers (ℕ)**: {1, 2, 3, …}
* **Integers (ℤ)**: {…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …}
* **Rational numbers (ℚ)**: Numbers expressible as p/q, q ≠ 0
* **Irrational numbers**: Not expressible as p/q (√2, π)
* **Real numbers (ℝ)**: ℚ ∪ irrational numbers

### Set Notation (write symbols clearly)

* ∈ belongs to | ∉ does not belong to
* ⊂ subset | ∪ union | ∩ intersection
* ∅ empty set

**Exam tip**: Write the set symbol once, then explain in words.

---

## 2. Logic & Mathematical Statements

* A **statement** is either true or false.
* ¬P (NOT P), P ∧ Q (AND), P ∨ Q (OR)
* P → Q (if P then Q), P ↔ Q (if and only if)

**Use**: assumptions, proofs, economic reasoning.

---

## 3. Variables, Constants & Equations

* **Variable**: quantity that can change (x, y, t)
* **Constant**: fixed quantity (a, b, π)

### Equation vs Identity

* **Equation**: true for specific values (x + 2 = 5)
* **Identity**: true for all values ((x + 1)² = x² + 2x + 1)

---

## 4. Functions (Very Important)

### Definition

A **function** assigns exactly one output to each input.

### Notation

* y = f(x)
* Example: f(x) = x² + 3x

### Domain & Range

* **Domain**: permissible input values
* **Range**: corresponding output values

**Example**: f(x) = √x → Domain: x ≥ 0

---

## 5. Graphs & Coordinate Geometry

* x-axis (horizontal), y-axis (vertical)
* Point: (x, y)

### Intercepts

* x-intercept: y = 0
* y-intercept: x = 0

**Applications**: demand–supply curves, cost curves, growth paths.

---

## 6. Exponents & Logarithms

### Exponent Rules

* xᵃ · xᵇ = xᵃ⁺ᵇ
* (xᵃ)ᵇ = xᵃᵇ
* x⁻¹ = 1/x

### Logarithms

* logₐx = y ⇔ aʸ = x
* **ln x**: natural logarithm (base e ≈ 2.718)

**Uses**: growth rates, elasticity, index numbers, econometrics.

---

## 7. Summation Notation (Σ)

### Definition

Σ denotes the sum of a sequence of terms.

### Form

Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ = x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ

### Mean

* Arithmetic Mean = Σxᵢ / n

**Uses**: national income, total cost, expected value.

---

## 8. Calculus Essentials (ULTRA-TOPPER VERSION)

Calculus is the study of **change and accumulation**. In exams, clarity of interpretation matters more than complex math.

---

### 8.1 Limits

#### Definition (Ranker Style)

A **limit** describes the value that a function approaches as the independent variable approaches a particular point.

#### Notation

limₓ→a f(x)

#### Intuition

* Limit checks behavior, not exact value
* Function may or may not be defined at x = a

#### Exam Line (use this)

> Limits help in understanding continuity and defining derivatives.

---

### 8.2 Continuity (Often Asked Indirectly)

A function f(x) is **continuous at x = a** if:

1. f(a) is defined
2. limₓ→a f(x) exists
3. limₓ→a f(x) = f(a)

**Economic meaning**: no sudden jumps in cost or output.

---

### 8.3 Derivatives

#### Definition (Perfect Exam Definition)

The derivative of a function represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of one variable with respect to another.

#### Notations

* dy/dx
* f′(x)

#### Basic Rules (Must Remember)

* d/dx (xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹
* d/dx (constant) = 0

#### Example

If y = x²
→ dy/dx = 2x

At x = 3, marginal value = 6

#### Economic Interpretation (Very Important)

* dy/dx → marginal change
* MC = dTC/dQ
* MP = dQ/dL

#### Ranker One-Liner

> A positive derivative implies an increasing functional relationship.

---

### 8.4 Second Derivative (High-Scoring Add-on)

* Second derivative = rate of change of the first derivative

Notation:

* d²y/dx²

Meaning:

* Positive → convex function
* Negative → concave function

**Used in**: profit maximization, cost curves.

---

### 8.5 Maxima and Minima (Favourite Exam Topic)

Steps:

1. Find first derivative
2. Set dy/dx = 0
3. Use second derivative test

* d²y/dx² < 0 → maximum
* d²y/dx² > 0 → minimum

---

### 8.6 Integrals

#### Definition (Ranker Style)

An integral represents the **total accumulation** of a variable over a given range.

#### Notation

∫ f(x) dx

#### Basic Rule

∫ xⁿ dx = (xⁿ⁺¹)/(n+1) + C

#### Example

∫ x² dx = x³/3 + C

#### Economic Interpretation

* Total cost from marginal cost
* Consumer & producer surplus

#### Ranker One-Liner

> Integration aggregates marginal values into totals.

---

### 8.7 Definite vs Indefinite Integrals

* Indefinite: ∫ f(x) dx → general form
* Definite: ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx → numerical value

**Meaning**: total change between limits.

---

### 8.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Mention Once = Bonus)

It states that **differentiation and integration are inverse processes**.

| Symbol  | Meaning           |
| ------- | ----------------- |

| lim     | approaching value |
