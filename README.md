# CALCULUS ESSENTIALS — COMPLETE & EXAM-PERFECT

Calculus has **two core ideas**:

1. **Differentiation** → study of *change* (marginal)
2. **Integration** → study of *accumulation* (total)

Everything else revolves around these.

---

## 1. LIMITS (Foundation of Calculus)

### What is a Limit?

A **limit** is the value that a function *approaches* as the independent variable approaches a certain point.

### Notation

[
\lim_{x \to a} f(x)
]

### Key Understanding

* Limit ≠ value of the function
* Function may not even exist at that point
* Limit only checks **behaviour near the point**

### Why Limits Matter

* Used to define **continuity**
* Used to define **derivatives**

### Exam Gold Line

> Limits help analyse the behaviour of functions near a point.

---

## 2. CONTINUITY (Often Hidden in Questions)

### Definition

A function ( f(x) ) is **continuous at ( x = a )** if:

1. ( f(a) ) exists
2. ( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) ) exists
3. ( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) )

### Intuition

* No sudden jumps
* Smooth curve

### Economic Meaning

* Cost, output, or revenue changes smoothly

---

## 3. DERIVATIVES (MOST IMPORTANT)

### Definition (Perfect Exam Definition)

A **derivative** measures the **instantaneous rate of change** of one variable with respect to another.

### Notations (ALL ARE SAME)

* ( \dfrac{dy}{dx} )
* ( f'(x) )
* ( \dfrac{d}{dx}(y) )

### Meaning in Simple Words

> How fast one variable changes when another changes slightly.

---

### Basic Differentiation Rules (MUST MEMORISE)

1. (\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1})
2. (\dfrac{d}{dx}(\text{constant}) = 0)
3. (\dfrac{d}{dx}(ax^n) = a \cdot nx^{n-1})

---

### Example

If
[
y = x^2
]

Then
[
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x
]

At ( x = 3 ):
Marginal value = 6

---

### Economic Interpretation (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Concept          | Mathematical Form        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Marginal Cost    | ( MC = \dfrac{dTC}{dQ} ) |
| Marginal Revenue | ( MR = \dfrac{dTR}{dQ} ) |
| Marginal Product | ( MP = \dfrac{dQ}{dL} )  |

### Ranker Line

> A positive derivative implies an increasing relationship between variables.

---

## 4. SECOND DERIVATIVE (SCORING EDGE)

### Definition

The **second derivative** is the derivative of the first derivative.

### Notation

[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
]

### Interpretation

* ( > 0 ) → Convex curve
* ( < 0 ) → Concave curve

### Use

* Cost curves
* Growth behaviour
* Profit maximisation

---

## 5. MAXIMA AND MINIMA (FAVOURITE EXAM TOPIC)

### Meaning

* **Maximum** → highest value
* **Minimum** → lowest value

### Steps (WRITE IN EXAM)

1. Find first derivative
2. Set ( \dfrac{dy}{dx} = 0 )
3. Apply second derivative test

### Second Derivative Test

* ( \dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} < 0 ) → Maximum
* ( \dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} > 0 ) → Minimum

### Applications

* Profit maximisation
* Cost minimisation

---

## 6. INTEGRATION (TOTAL CONCEPT)

### Definition (Perfect)

An **integral** represents the **total accumulation** or **area under a curve**.

### Notation

[
\int f(x),dx
]

---

### Basic Integration Rule

[
\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C
]

(( C ) = constant of integration)

---

### Example

[
\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
]

---

### Economic Interpretation

| Concept       | Meaning          |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Total Cost    | Integral of MC   |
| Total Revenue | Integral of MR   |
| Surplus       | Area under curve |

### Ranker Line

> Integration converts marginal values into total values.

---

## 7. DEFINITE vs INDEFINITE INTEGRALS

### Indefinite Integral

[
\int f(x) dx
]

* General form
* No limits

### Definite Integral

[
\int_a^b f(x) dx
]

* Gives a numerical value
* Measures total change from ( a ) to ( b )

---

## 8. FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS (BONUS)

### Statement

Differentiation and integration are **inverse processes**.

(Mention once → bonus impression.)

---

## 9. GRAPHICAL INTERPRETATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

* Derivative → slope of tangent
* Second derivative → curvature
* Integral → area under curve

Even writing *“can be shown graphically”* helps.

---

## 10. KEY SYMBOLS (MEMORISE)

| Symbol                 | Meaning           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| ( \lim )               | approaching value |
| ( \dfrac{dy}{dx} )     | marginal change   |
| ( \dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} ) | curvature         |
| ( \int )               | total             |
| ( C )                  | constant          |

---

## 11. EXAM ANSWER STRUCTURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Always write in this order:**

1. Definition
2. Formula / notation
3. Example
4. Interpretation
5. Conclusion line

---

## 12. FINAL RECALL MAP (DO NOT FORGET)

* Limit → approach
* Continuity → smoothness
* Derivative → marginal
* Second derivative → curvature
* Integral → total

---

## PERFECT CLOSING LINE (USE THIS)

> Hence, calculus provides a powerful mathematical framework to analyse change and accumulation with precision.
